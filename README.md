# Function Calling with Observability

This repository is focused on demonstrating how to call functions with observability via different providers.

The code is organized into different folders, each representing a different provider (e.g. Langchain, Google Generative AI).

Each folder contains a README with instructions on how to run the code and see the observability data.

## Current Providers

- [Langchain](langchain/README.md)
- [Google Generative AI](google-generative-ai/README.md)

## Adding a new provider

If you'd like to add a new provider, please create a new folder with the name of the provider and add a README with instructions on how to run the code and see the observability data.

Please also update this README to include the new provider in the list above.

## Running the code

To run the code, clone the repository and navigate to the folder of the provider you'd like to use.

Follow the instructions in the README of that folder to run the code and see the observability data.

## Observability Data

The observability data is sent to the provider's dashboard. The data includes information about the function call, such as the input and output, as well as any errors that occurred.

The data is also logged to the console, so you can see it in real-time.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new provider or improve an existing one, please open a pull request.

Please make sure to follow the instructions in the README of the provider you're contributing to.
